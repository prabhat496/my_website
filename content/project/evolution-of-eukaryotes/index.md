The origin of Eukaryotes was a major singular step in evolution. The origin of life on earth goes back to around 4 billion year and life forms were morphologically similar for ~2 billion years. This change in structure and complexity happens with the sudden evolution of Eukaryotic cells. Very less is known about the intermediate steps in the course of evolution. Eukaryotic cells are fundamentally different from those of bacteria and archaea at almost every level of organization, starting with their physical size. The earliest common Eukaryotic ancestor already has most of the modern Eukaryotic
features as a nucleus and other endomembrane system organelles. The most widely accepted hypothesis is of Endosymbiosis, in which a bacteria is engulfed by an Archaea. They formed a symbiotic relationship in which host Archaea provide a stable environment and food for bacteria while bacteria provides energy to the symbiotic system. It later evolved into a eukaryotic cell where bacteria assumes the role of mitochondria and Archaea becomes the cell. This transition from a symbiotic relation
to complete eukaryotic cell happened in a series of evolutionary steps. Since there are no intermediates or fossils, which suggests this transition had happened very quickly inevolutionary timescale.
